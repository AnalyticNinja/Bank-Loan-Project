# Bank-Loan-Project

## Problem Statement

A complete Bank Loan Report is required in order to monitor and analyse our bank's lending activity and performance. The purpose of this report is to give insight into important loan-related variables and how they evolve over time. The report will assist us in making data-driven choices, monitoring the quality of our loan portfolio, and identifying patterns that can guide our lending plans.

### KPI's Focussed On:

Total Loan Applications:

Calculate the aggregate number of loan applications received within a specified timeframe. It is crucial to observe Month-to-Date (MTD) loan applications and monitor changes Month-over-Month (MoM).

Total Funded Amount:

Gain an understanding of the overall funds disbursed as loans. Keep a close watch on Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Funded Amount and analyze Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations in this metric.

Total Amount Received:

Monitor the total sum received from borrowers to assess the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. Analyze Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.

Average Interest Rate:

Calculate the mean interest rate across all loans. Monitor Month-to-Date (MTD) rates and track Month-over-Month (MoM) variations to gain insights into the overall cost of our lending portfolio.

Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):

Assess the average DTI for our borrowers to gauge their financial health. Compute the average DTI for all loans, observe Month-to-Month (MTD) values, and track fluctuations Month-over-Month (MoM).


### Good Loan Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Good Loan Application Percentage:

Calculate the proportion of loan applications classified as 'Good Loans.' This category encompasses loans with a status of 'Fully Paid' and 'Current.'

Good Loan Applications:

Identify the total count of loan applications falling under the 'Good Loan' category, comprising loans with a status of 'Fully Paid' and 'Current.'

Good Loan Funded Amount:

Determine the total funds disbursed as 'Good Loans.' This includes the principal amounts of loans with a status of 'Fully Paid' and 'Current.'

Good Loan Total Received Amount:

Track the overall amount received from borrowers for 'Good Loans,' covering all payments made on loans with a status of 'Fully Paid' and 'Current.'

### Bad Loan Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Bad Loan Application Percentage:

Calculate the percentage of loan applications categorized as 'Bad Loans.' This category specifically includes loans with a status of 'Charged Off.'

Bad Loan Applications:

Identify the total count of loan applications categorized as 'Bad Loans,' consisting of loans with a status of 'Charged Off.'

Bad Loan Funded Amount:

Determine the total funds disbursed as 'Bad Loans,' comprising the principal amounts of loans with a status of 'Charged Off.'

Bad Loan Total Received Amount:

Track the overall amount received from borrowers for 'Bad Loans,' including all payments made on loans with a status of 'Charged Off.'

Loan Status Grid View:

To obtain a thorough understanding of our lending operations and monitor loan performance, we aim to generate a grid view report organized by 'Loan Status.' This report will be a valuable tool for analyzing key indicators associated with various loan statuses, including 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received,' 'Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount,' 'MTD Amount Received,' 'Average Interest Rate,' and 'Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI).' By providing insights into these metrics, the grid view will enable us to make informed decisions and assess the overall health of our loan portfolio.

Dashboard 2: Overview:

In our Bank Loan Report project, our objective is to visually represent crucial loan-related metrics and trends using diverse chart types in a second dashboard named "Overview." These charts will offer a clear and insightful perspective on our lending operations, supporting data-driven decision-making and providing valuable insights into various loan parameters. The specific chart requirements are as follows:

Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):

Chart Type: Line Chart
Metrics: 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received'
X-Axis: Month (based on 'Issue Date')
Y-Axis: Metric Values
Objective: Identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities over time.
Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map):

Chart Type: Filled Map
Metrics: 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received'
Geographic Regions: States
Objective: Visual representation of lending metrics categorized by state, highlighting regions with significant activity and assessing regional disparities.
Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart):

Chart Type: Donut Chart
Metrics: 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received'
Segments: Loan Terms (e.g., 36 months, 60 months)
Objective: Depict loan statistics based on different terms, understanding the distribution of loans across various lengths.
Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart):

Chart Type: Bar Chart
Metrics: 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received'
X-Axis: Employee Length Categories (e.g., 1 year, 5 years, 10+ years)
Y-Axis: Metric Values
Objective: Illustrate the distribution of lending metrics among borrowers with different employment lengths.
Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart):

Chart Type: Bar Chart
Metrics: 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received'
X-Axis: Loan Purpose Categories (e.g., debt consolidation, credit card refinancing)
Y-Axis: Metric Values
Objective: Visual breakdown of loan metrics based on stated purposes, aiding in understanding borrowers' primary reasons for seeking financing.
Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map):

Chart Type: Tree Map
Metrics: 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received'
Hierarchy: Home Ownership Categories (e.g., own, rent, mortgage)
Objective: Display loan metrics categorized by different home ownership statuses, providing a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements.

### DETAILS DASHBOARD 3

We recognise the need for a thorough 'Details Dashboard' in our Bank Loan Report project, which gives a consolidated view of all the critical information inside our loan data. This Details Dashboard seeks to provide a comprehensive summary of essential loan-related metrics and data points, allowing users to quickly access critical information.
Objective:

The Details Dashboard's major goal is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for obtaining critical loan data. It will be a one-stop shop for users looking for in-depth information on our loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance.
